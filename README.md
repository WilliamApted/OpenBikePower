## Summary
This library is intended for providing cycling power estimates based off a variety of input parameters. 

Dedicated bike power meters are typically quite expensive and inaccessible to most. Hence the possibilities for this library could include creating mobile applications to provide realtime power estimates using data from the gps and accelerometers or allowing users to retrospectively calculate their power along a tracked route. 

## Platform support
This library is a .NET Standard library, and hence can be used with .net framework, .net core and other .net projects. This means there is full cross platform support.

## Examples
*Examples coming soon.*

## Documentation
*Documentation/wiki links will be added soon.*
